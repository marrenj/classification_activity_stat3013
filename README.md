### About
This is a repository for my final project for STAT 301-3 at Northwestern University in Spring 2022. This project uses loan repayment data to build predictive models that classify whether a high percentage of repayments on a loan will go to principal rather than interest.


### Setup
Data setup can be found in the main branch of the repo. 


### Models
This repo is organized such that the scripts for creating, tuning, and evaluating each model are located within their respective folders. 


### Predictions for Kaggle
Model predictions submitted to kaggle are located in the main branch of the repo.
